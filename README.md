# Consumer Health OpenID Connect Profile(CHOP) - DRAFT

This is an OpenID Connect profile which outlines specific content of the `id_token`. It is designed to address logistical issues surrounding access to health information. The goals of this profile are:

1. To communicate digital identity information in a consistent fashion.
2. To provide a consistent way represent identifiers, which often act as pointers to health information. 
3. To provide a consistent way to model relationships among people and organizations.

This is a draft. Please contribute by using issues feature or make a pull request.

The **CHOP** profile outlines claims (i.e. fields) to be contained within the `id_token`.


**Note**: In the context of identity, the word "claim" is referring to any given field in the `id_token`.  The meaning of "claim" in this context is unrelated to the meaning of the word "claim" in a healthcare context.

Fields / Claims
---------------

This section profileâ€™s fields individually.


Goal 1: Digitial Identity
________________________

* `vot` - To  encode Identity Assurance Level (`1`,`2`, or `3`) and  Authenticator Assurance Level (`1`,`2`, or `3`).  This profile requires that a numerical value for `P` and `C` are set.  (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `C1`,` C2`, `C3`).  All other `vot` data is optional.

* `vtm` - To reference the  specific set of vector values as defined by NIST 800-63-3.  The value of the `vtm`  claim shall be `https://github.com/TransparentHealth/800-63-3-trustmark/`.

* `verified_claims` - To provide details on the id verification event, if needed. (e.g. Details on a driver's license may be stored here.)

Goal 2: Identifiers
___________________


* `document` - This profile extends the iGov OIDC `doc` claim for documents.https://openid.net/specs/openid-igov-openid-connect-1_0-ID1.html#ClaimsResponse and should help facilitate patient linking and matching. The extension allows additional metadata to be added to fields including codes for `country`, `subdivision` (e.g. state), `url`. The helps better codify state issued documents such as a driver's license. In addition, Patient identifiers in various systems may be stored. For example, a FHIR Patient ID along with the URL to the FHIR server to which it pertains may be stores within the `doc` claim.

Goal 3: Relationships
_____________________

* `agent-to-organization` - For employment relationships. Example: Bob works for ACME Health
* `member-to-organization` - For membership/client/patient relationships. Examples: Bob has insurance through ACME Health. Carol is a client of City Mission. Carlos is patient at Capitol Clinic.  
* `member-to-member` - For family relationships. Examples: Carlos is the spouse of Carol. Frank wants Eve to have access to his records. 
* `agent-to-member` - For Patient/provider relationships. Examples:  Alice, of ACME Health, is the care coordinator for Alice.  Charlie, of City Mission, is the care coordinator for Frank. 

Other Claims:
____________

* `middle_name` - To encode a middle name for aiding with patient linking and matching when no unique identifier (e.g. social security number) is known. (national identity)

* `sex` - A field to indicate biological/birth sex.  Values are `male`, `female`, and `other`.
